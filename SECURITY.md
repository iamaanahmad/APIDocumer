# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

APIDocumer is an evolving project. Security fixes are applied to the latest `main` branch first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open public issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. Email maintainers with details (impact, reproduction, proof-of-concept).
2. Include affected version/commit and environment details.
3. Allow time for triage and coordinated disclosure.

If no private contact channel is available, open a minimal issue requesting a private reporting channel without disclosing exploit details.

## What to Include

- Vulnerability type and impact
- Reproduction steps
- Affected files/endpoints/components
- Suggested remediation (if available)

## Disclosure

After a fix is available, maintainers may publish a security advisory and release notes.
